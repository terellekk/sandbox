# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple programme to demonstrate my understanding of functional programming, correct use of dictionaries([key values]), lists and importing libraries.

## Usage

```python

#library
import random 


# returns a choice at random from the list stored in computer_choice
randomizer = random.choice(computer_choice)

# takes 2 arguments
def checkWin(player, computer)

# the key values from the get_choices function, that were stored in choices2 are now being used as arguments for the checkWin function
result = checkWin(choices2["player"], choices2["computer"])
```
